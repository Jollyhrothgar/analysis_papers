\chapter{Variables and Calculations}
\label{ch:VariablesAndCalculations}
Though the process of extracting the variables presented in this chapter can
sometimes require several steps (or even its own chapter) we present the
variables in this chapter from a physical standpoint. 

These variables characterize the dynamics of the beams intersecting in the
PHENIX interaction region (IR). Our goal in the vernier analysis is to
calculate the effective detector cross section for our Beam Beam Counter (BBC)
photomultiplier tube detector, as well as the RHIC machine luminosity,
$\mathcal{L}_{RHIC}$. We must also use a realistic model for highly
relativistic collisions between two intersecting beams.

The basic equations, models and variables used in the analysis are summarized
here; no derivations will be provided (but they will be referenced for the
interested reader). I will go into detail discussing the extraciton of each
parameter within relevent chapters.

The effective detector cross section~\cite{Drees2013} can be expressed as:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:detector_xsec}
\sigma_{ZDC}^{eff} = {{R_{max} 2\pi n_{B} n_{Y} \sigma_{x} \sigma_{y}}\over{n_{bunch}
f_{bunch} N_{B} N_{Y} }}
\end{equation}

with various parameters are defined in Table~\ref{tab:ana_vars}.

We use the standard relativistic intersecting beam model for colliding
bunches~\cite{an888}, which is defined to be:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:reletivistic_beam_final} 
\mathcal{L} = {{n_{bunch} f_{bunch} N_{B} N_{Y} }\over{ 2 \pi^{2} \sigma_{x}
\sigma_{y}\sigma{z}^2}} \int \int
e^{-\left({{z^{2}}\over{\sigma_{z}^{2}}}+{{c^{2}t^{2}}\over{\sigma_{z}^{2}}}\right)} c dt
\end{equation}
