\caption{ Two different scanning patterns were used in Run 12. Type 2 was previously
used in past years prior to 2012, and is included in this year's set of scans as a consistency check.
Type 1 was used for the majority of the scans in 2012. The scan order introduces
systematic effects based on rate losses in the beam width calculation, which are described
later.}
