\section{Overview}
Now that we have discussed the various aparatuses provided by the PHENIX
experiment, we can go into more depth with the process of engineering features.
For this analysis, we consider only events which are identified by the Muon Arms
subsystem as being muons. The raw data provided by PHENIX is quite complex, and
at the hardware level is generally not
